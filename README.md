# Student_Score_Prediction
## Objective:– 
Predict student final scores based on study-related and socio-economic factors.

## 📌 Model Performance Summary

In this project, multiple machine learning algorithms were evaluated—including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor—to predict student exam performance based on study habits and lifestyle factors.
After training and testing all models, Linear Regression outperformed the others, achieving an impressive accuracy (R² score) of approximately 0.8993.

This indicates that Linear Regression was able to capture the underlying relationships in the data effectively, making it the best-performing model for this dataset.

## Insights:–
* The analysis reveals that academic performance is shaped by a balanced combination of study habits, lifestyle factors, and behavioral patterns. Key drivers include consistent study schedules, healthy sleep routines, lower screen-time, and strong attendance.
* School or coaching institutes can use such models to identify
  at-risk students early and provide targeted support.
